# **J**ust **A**nother **M**eet **M**ute

_Inspired by weeks of remote work while using Google Meet for video conferencing._ Did you need to block video and audio streams in the Google Meet VC when there is a phone call, your child enters the room or you just need to leave to a loo? It is always a two click action after taking your mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen. Sometimes you do not care about time and sometimes you do. It would be great if you could just do a single click or pressing a shortcut and mute audio and video in all active Google Meet sessions. And yes, some of us sometimes have more than one VC running in parallel.

This application allows to mute microphone and disable camera in all currently active Google Meet sessions.
Enabling back either of them has to be done manually and separately for each session.
When the active tab has ongoing Google Meet session and the microphone is muted, it is possible to unmute the microphone by pressing and holding a key combination (by default SPACE key). Releasing the key-combination immediately mutes the microphone back. I admit to steal this from [Google Meet Push To Talk](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-meet-push-to-talk/pgpidfocdapogajplhjofamgeboonmmj). Huge thank you them for the idea.

While there are many similar Chrome extensions (hence "just another..." in the name) that do more or less same job, I did not find one that aggregates the above functionality.
There is no special visual notification about status change of the Google Meet meetings. Multiple clicks (or shortcut press) behave idempotently.
